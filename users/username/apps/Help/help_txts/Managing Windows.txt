Windows have two to three buttons in the
top-right corner.

The red button closes the app.
The yellow button minimizes the window.
The blue button allows you to resize the
window.

Uniminimizing apps:
    In order to restore a window, you
    only need to open the "Unminimizer"
    app that looks like a stack of three
    windows. Then, click on the app you
    wish to open!

You can drag the window around by the
light grey tab at the top.

Resizing windows:
    When you click the blue resize
    button, a white rectangle will
    highlight the borders of the app.
    Click where you would like the
    top-left and bottom right corners to
    be.
